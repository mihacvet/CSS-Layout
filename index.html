                        show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter.
                        You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself,
                        someone who's gonna protect her. Uh, look me up 
                        when you get there.
                        Uncle Jailbird Joey? The car, Dad, I mean 
                        He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car 
                        tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea 
                        how important this was, do you have any clue? 
                        That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever

                        this video unit. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.Now, now, Biff, 
                        now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive 
                        it. Hi, son. Well, I figured, what the hell. Let's go. Marty 
                        you gotta come back with me. What Lorraine, what?

                        Right, I got it. Now, of course not, Biff,
                        now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Yeah,

                <p>You do? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire 
                   family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god 
                   has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around 
                   here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the 
                   eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He 
                   had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. What 
                   Lorraine, what? Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you 
                   doing? Alright, let's set your destination time. This 
                   is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at 
                   exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, 
                   I painted a white line on the street way over there, 
                   that's where you start from.
